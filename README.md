# Description
We've all played it before... You find a target trash can and throw a wad of paper into it. The greater the distance the more impressive the throw.
Our game simulates that in augmented reality. Try to get the greatest throw!

# Text Tutorial
The game starts at the starting screen. Press the button to enter placement mode. In placement mode, you can place a trashcan on a surface. Once placed you will be taken to the flicking mode. In flicking mode drag your finger across the screen to gain power. Greater distance drags translate to more powerful throws. If the ball falls into the trashcan you are celebrated with confetti and the distance of your throw.

# What to Expect
For our final project, you will be able to place down a trash can on an AR plane. After the can is placed, the player will then be able to swipe on their device to toss a ball.
The goal of the game will be to toss the ball into the can to score points. You will be able to reset the position of the can to place it in a new spot.
