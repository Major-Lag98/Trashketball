# What to Expect
For our final project, you will be able to place down a trash can on an AR plane. After the can is placed, the player will then be able to swipe on their device to toss a ball.
The goal of the game will be to toss the ball into the can to score points. You will be able to reset the position of the can to place it in a new spot.

Scoring, design, and other gameplay mechanics are not finalized and will be prone to change. If any changes are to be implemented, they will be recorded here.
